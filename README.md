# Introduction
The philosophy behind it is to build a racing dashboard, focusing only on the important information you need during a race as clearly as possible, ignoring fancy unnecessary things, and at the same time, looking as good as possible. I hope you like it, and I would love to get your feedback! I have a couple of unique features on the roadmap
